# jabber.net

A fork of the original [jabber-net](https://code.google.com/p/jabber-net/)
project. The initial goals of this fork are:

1. Separate libraries so that core classes do not depend on any visual .NET
   components; all of that should be in Muzzle.
2. Get the core library into a state where it may be used in Unity Web Player.

There will be additional changes and future goals will definitely arise, but
these are the immediate goals.
